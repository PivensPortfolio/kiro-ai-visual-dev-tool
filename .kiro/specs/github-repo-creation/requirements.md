# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create and initialize a new GitHub repository directly from their local project workspace. The system will handle repository creation, initial commit, and remote setup to streamline the development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new GitHub repository for my existing project, so that I can version control my code and collaborate with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates repository creation THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub using personal access token or OAuth
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a new repository with the specified name and settings
3. WHEN repository creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL initialize local git repository if not already present
4. WHEN local git is initialized THEN the system SHALL add the GitHub repository as remote origin
5. IF the project has uncommitted changes THEN the system SHALL create an initial commit with all project files
6. WHEN initial commit is created THEN the system SHALL push the code to the new GitHub repository

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure repository settings during creation, so that the repository meets my project's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a repository THEN the system SHALL allow setting repository visibility (public/private)
2. WHEN creating a repository THEN the system SHALL allow adding a repository description
3. WHEN creating a repository THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling repository features (issues, wiki, projects)
4. IF a README.md exists in the project THEN the system SHALL use it as the repository README
5. IF no README.md exists THEN the system SHALL offer to create a basic README with project information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling during repository creation, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error message with resolution steps
2. WHEN repository name already exists THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative names or allow user to choose different name
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options with exponential backoff
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform user and suggest waiting period
5. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback options to clean up partial changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the repository setup after creation, so that I can confirm everything is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository creation completes THEN the system SHALL display the repository URL
2. WHEN repository creation completes THEN the system SHALL verify remote connection is working
3. WHEN repository creation completes THEN the system SHALL confirm initial push was successful
4. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide next steps or common actions (clone URL, settings link)
